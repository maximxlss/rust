# Fork readme
This is my fork of rust with spread syntax support:
```Rust
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3];
    let b = [...a, 4, 5, 6];
    assert_eq!(b, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]);
}
```
To run, follow the same instructions as normal.

### Details
Basically, this adds a new expression (that kind of replaces the legacy inclusive range) that is processed in a special way when put in an array. Functionally, this allows to spread existing arrays into an array literal.

This is very hacky, in a real implementation it should probably be embedded into the array nodes, but I started doing this first and also it might be less work this way. Also, since this is an expression and I didn't implement any MIR lowering for it (except for the special array logic) you really don't want to use it elsewhere, or you're risking summoning the ice demons. It's also (improperly) typed the same as the underlying array.

The operation moves from the original array.

## Why Rust?

- **Performance:** Fast and memory-efficient, suitable for critical services, embedded devices, and easily integrated with other languages.

- **Reliability:** Our rich type system and ownership model ensure memory and thread safety, reducing bugs at compile-time.

- **Productivity:** Comprehensive documentation, a compiler committed to providing great diagnostics, and advanced tooling including package manager and build tool ([Cargo]), auto-formatter ([rustfmt]), linter ([Clippy]) and editor support ([rust-analyzer]).
