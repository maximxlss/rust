# Fork readme
This is my fork of Rust with experimental support for default function
arguments:

```rust
#![feature(function_param_defaults)]

fn score(base: i32, multiplier: i32 = 2, bonus: i32 = 1) -> i32 {
    base * multiplier + bonus
}

fn main() {
    assert_eq!(score(10), 21);
    assert_eq!(score(10, 3), 31);
    assert_eq!(score(10, 3, 4), 34);
}
```

To run it, follow the normal compiler build instructions and enable the
`function_param_defaults` feature.

### Details

Defaults must form a trailing suffix and are constant expressions evaluated in
the declaration's scope. The experiment supports free functions, inherent
methods, generics, and cross-crate calls while preserving the function's full
type and ABI. Calls through function pointers or `Fn` traits therefore still
require every argument.

This is intentionally a small implementation for experimentation rather than
an RFC-ready language feature. Trait methods, closures, foreign/non-Rust
functions, splatted functions, and defaulted parameter types containing
late-bound lifetimes are not supported.

The spread syntax experiment is available on the
[spreads](https://github.com/maximxlss/rust/tree/spreads) branch.

## Why Rust?

- **Performance:** Fast and memory-efficient, suitable for critical services, embedded devices, and easily integrated with other languages.

- **Reliability:** Our rich type system and ownership model ensure memory and thread safety, reducing bugs at compile-time.

- **Productivity:** Comprehensive documentation, a compiler committed to providing great diagnostics, and advanced tooling including package manager and build tool ([Cargo]), auto-formatter ([rustfmt]), linter ([Clippy]) and editor support ([rust-analyzer]).
